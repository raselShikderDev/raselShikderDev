# Rasel Shikder 👋

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) student** who enjoys building reliable, well-structured web applications with modern JavaScript and TypeScript. 

I’m especially interested in where **technology meets business**: making practical engineering decisions, keeping systems simple, and building software that can actually grow and be maintained over time.

## ⚡ What I Do Well

* Turn ideas into **production-ready web applications**
* Build **robust, well-validated APIs**
* Develop **clean, responsive, and interactive UIs**
* Improve existing codebases through **refactoring and optimization**
* Learn quickly and adapt to new tools when the problem demands it

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React (Vite)
* Next.js (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Redux Toolkit & RTK Query
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB with Mongoose
* Zod (shared schema validation across frontend & backend)
* Redis (basic usage for rate limiting and auth flows)

### Databases & Tools

* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL (learning & exploration)
* Prisma
* Git & GitHub (multi-device workflow)
* RESTful API design
* Environment-based configuration
* Deployment with Vercel and Render

## 🧠 How I Approach Development

I prioritize **clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability** over unnecessary complexity.

* Structured, readable codebases over clever shortcuts
* Strong preference for **type safety and shared schemas**
* Focus on understanding root causes, not just fixing symptoms
* Simple, scalable solutions instead of premature abstraction

---

## 🚀 Projects & Experience

I’ve worked on full-stack projects where I:

* Implemented features end-to-end, from UI to database
* Designed backend workflows and data models
* Improved performance and structure of existing systems
* Built applications following **strict API specifications**
* Maintained full-stack projects within a single repository

Many of these projects are learning-oriented, but they’re developed with **production discipline**—validation, predictable data flow, and consistency matter.

## 🎯 Current Focus

* Advanced TypeScript concepts and patterns
* Full-stack architecture with Next.js
* State management using Redux Toolkit & RTK Query
* Exploring relational databases with PostgreSQL and Prisma
* Becoming a stronger problem solver and collaborator
